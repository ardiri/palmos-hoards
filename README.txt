  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
         YOU MUST REMOVE ANY PREVIOUS VERSIONS BEFORE INSTALLATION
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

  HOW TO PLAY:
  ============

  Start Hoards of the Deep Realm by tapping on the application icon in the 
  application launcher.  After a short while,  you will be presented  with 
  the main Hoards of the Deep Realm screen in which you may select a level
  set to  edit (only  custom level  sets) or to play,  and  setup any game
  configuration options.

  Using the hard keys or the stylus, you must move John  Bandit to collect
  all the gold available in a level. Use your vaporizer to  blast holes in 
  turf for  trapping  monks (who  may  carry gold),  creating  routes  for 
  escapes or paths to  buried objects. When all gold  is collected,  extra 
  routes may be shown. Guide John to the top of the screen to  continue to 
  the next level.

  Monks patrol each level and getting caught by one results in death. They
  can pick up objects and may drop them or need to be trapped to give them
  up. They can be killed if trapped for tool long and will re-appear.

  Consult your handheld device manual for instructions of selecting a menu 
  item. When a game is active,  you may tap the speaker icon at the bottom 
  left  of the screen to get to the  configuration screen.  It is possible 
  to pause the current game in progress by tapping the paw icon.

  REGISTRATION:
  =============
 
  Hoards of the Deep Realm is shareware,  the  demonstration  version does 
  not allow the  player to  generate high score  codes or allow  more than
  five levels be played in succession. To access  these features, a device 
  identification  number  is  required  to  generate  a  unique  unlocking 
  registration datafile.

  You can get to the registration screen by  selecting the 'Register' menu 
  item in the 'Game' menu.  It is very  important to ensure  that you copy 
  down the device identification exactly as it is presented in this dialog
  as follows:

   45:6D:75:6C:61:74:6F:72:39 <--- generated from the "Emulator" username

  It is  very common that users copy down this information incorrectly and
  hence delay the registration process. An exact match is required for the
  restration process to succeed.

  REGISTRATION IS FREE - however, you will be required to fill in a survey
  asking for minimal information about your Palm Computing Platform  usage
  at the following web address:

    http://www.ardiri.com/index.cfm?redir=palm&cat=hoards&subcat=survey

  Payments (donations of $10US) are  accepted ONLY  at  PalmGearHQ and are 
  not refundable. Donations support future developments and the developer.  
  If you paid for this software in  another manner - you  have been ripped 
  off. Report any occurances by sending an email to aaron@ardiri.com

  To be included the the  global high score table (http://www.ardiri.com),
  send an  email to aaron@ardiri. com with  the information  shown  in the 
  'Register Your Score'  dialog.  This will  only appear  if you  beat the 
  internal high score or if you request it using the menu option under the 
  'Score' menu on the main page.
 
  Thankyou for downloading and playing Hoards of the Deep Realm!
